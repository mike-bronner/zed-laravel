//! Classification tables for Eloquent / DB builder methods.
//!
//! Every method name we recognise falls into one of the `MethodKind` variants
//! defined in [`super::chain`]. The categorisation here drives both link
//! classification during extraction and the dispatch logic inside the chain
//! walker: a `ModeFlipToBase` flips the mode, a `CollectionTerminator` flips
//! to `EloquentCollection`, a `ChainTerminator` ends the chain entirely.
//!
//! The lists are small (~30 entries each) and the lookup is a linear scan
//! over `&'static [&'static str]` slices. That's faster than a `HashMap`
//! at this size and saves an allocation per call.
